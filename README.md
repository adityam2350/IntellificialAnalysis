# IntellificialAnalysis

This is an analysis I completed in conjunction with an employee from Intellificial. The problem statement was to develop a model that can identify cases of
fraud in order to maximizes savings for a bank. This is the dataset I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
